# Developing

This document describes development setup and workflow.

All documentation is written in markdown to reduce friction writing documentation.  Sphinx generates documentation and directives are passed using markdown code blocks.  See [The MyST Syntax Guide][myst] for details.

## Debugging

TODO: Document [debugpy] debugger integration here once the `--debugpy` flag has been added.

## Integrations

Check out the [MyST-Markdown VS Code extension][myst-code] for MyST extended syntax highlighting.
